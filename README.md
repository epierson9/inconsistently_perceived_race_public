# inconsistently_perceived_race_public

We did preliminary analysis in Python and used R to run the analyses and construct the tables and figures for this paper.

# To run the R scripts
## `plot_regression_res.R`
- Uncomment function calls that start with `plot_` to view plots and regression output used in the paper (uncomment lines 592, 668-673 to create the main and supplemental figures)

## `make_descriptive_stats_table.R`
- Replace `path-to-STATE-data` (ex. `path-to-AZ-data.csv`) with the path to the raw state data

# To run the Jupyter notebooks
- Replace `config[base_path]` or `base_path` with the path to this directory, `inconsistently_perceived_race_public`
- Replace `path-to-STATE-data` (ex. `path-to-AZ-data.csv`) with the path to the raw state data
